## Design Brief
**Task:** Re-designing a book awards list on [goodreads.com](https://www.goodreads.com/).

**Learning Topic:** Creating hierarchy using typography size & style

## Reflections
- What does adding drop shadow do for the design? If it does nothing, remove it. 
- Card design can be overused. Use it if there is some sort of interactivity (eg. if users can tap on it to expand or go to another link). Otherwise, just use spacing (or lines) to communicate a division between the content. Cards can take up a lot of space to be sure to consider what the cards are meant to do
- Some designs look very wireframe-ish or dated because of the hard outlines of elements/grids. You don't need lines to make the section 'obvious', you can also use negative space! (Eg, the left navigation bars) 

`#dropshadow`   `#cards`
