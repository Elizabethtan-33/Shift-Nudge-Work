## Before
This was not a redesign project. I combined elements that I'd like to see in my ideal streaming app based on existing streaming sites, and other review sites (such as IMDB & Letterboxd)

Specifically, 
- The clean minimalist look on Apple TV. Hero Images are strong, not overcrowded with text.
- Showcase of cast and the number of appearance on Apple TV (For those fan-girl moments) 
- The convenient all-episode previews on Netflix
- User & Critic Reviews & Ratings on IMDB
