## Before
This was not a redesign project. I combined elements that I'd like to see in my ideal streaming app from existing streaming sites, and other review sites (such as IMDB & Letterboxd)

Specifically, 
- On Apple TV - The clean minimalist look. Hero Images are strong, not overcrowded with text
- On Apple TV - Showcase of cast and episode appearances (For those fan-girl moments) 
- On Netflix - The convenient episode synopsis at a glance
- On IMDB - User & Critic Reviews & Ratings
