## Design Brief
**Task:** Picking a favourite TV show and designing your ideal streaming service interface

**Learning Topics:** Focus on grids & containers to become faster at responsive design

## Reflections
- Text line heights need not be standard across the page. It depends on readability & prominence you want to place on the text section, which is affected by the text size & width.
- Split up different text styles into different text boxes. It makes it easier to make components when there are more screens
- Prototyping in Figma: If elements are groups instead of frames, sometimes the prototype will have extra white spaces that bleed out during horizontal & vertical scrolling (Common mistake with many forum chats on it)
- When someting feels cramped, spend time to play around with the orientation of the elements. There are suprisingly many different options! (It can be a hassle so maybe come back to it another day. Don't waste time looking at other online samples, just intuitively move elements around freely and experiment on your own first)
