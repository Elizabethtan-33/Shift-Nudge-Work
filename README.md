# Shift Nudge Work
Work produced during the Shift Nudge Course

In June 2022, I joined <a href="https://shiftnudge.com/">Shift Nudge</a> as a commitment to improve my UI skills. Despite already practicing product design for close to 5 years, this specialized course is giving new perspectives, rechallenging fundamentals and inspiring new levels of obsession. 

Aside from course work, I'll be working together with trained design advisors and industry experts to help refine my work. I'm documenting by progress here on Github, as means of public accountability and also as an excuse to explore Git a little more.
